                <p>You tell the kids how rain stopped coming and your tea trees died, how your workers collapsed from heat exhaustion, and
                they slept in the shades of your family compound sharing whatever little food your family have saved. You really believe that wasting water is
                unacceptable and it is reserved for people to survive. When you finish your story, you look up and see so many eyes staring back at you. Your breathing stops “What have I
                done” - you start freaking out “they will laugh at my accent”.
