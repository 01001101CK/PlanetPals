                <p>You are shocked to see a girl, Hailey, leaving the shower without turning the water off. “This is unacceptable back
                home!” You think. You grab Hailey’s arm and pull her back to the shower “You cannot waste water, you have to turn it
                off. Hailey is also shocked and tries to get away, saying you are hurting her. The tighter you grab her, the louder she yells.
