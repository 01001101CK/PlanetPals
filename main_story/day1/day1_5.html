                <p>Councillor Kamal explains that she can’t fix your accent right away, but you have good ears and you can listen and
                adjust overtime. She asks about what you like to do, “studying plants” you say. She tells you she is making a special
                visit to Circle Forest this afternoon, a native habitat restoration
                site with the Detroit Arboretum NGO, and she can take you with her.
