                <p>Today’s the first day of high school. Even though you learned to speak English at home, as soon as you opened your
                mouth, your accent was made fun of by all of your classmates. They called you ‘weird’ ‘different’ and told you to ‘go
                back to china’. You feel mad, angry, hurt, and ashamed.</p>
