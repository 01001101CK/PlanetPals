                <p>Your parents were determined to keep a sense of normalcy even though Sri Lanka has had the worst climate decade in its
                history. Coming from a farming, collectivist, patriarchal society and as the youngest of 3, you had an easy childhood
                with your older brothers groomed and expected to take over the family ceylon tea business, the premier export crop. </p>
