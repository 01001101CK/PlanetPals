                <p>Sri Lanka is a farming, community oriented, patriarchal society experiencing the worst climate decade in its history,
                starting with the worst drought 8 years ago. You are the youngest of 3 with two older brothers. You had an easy
                childhood as your brothers are groomed to take over the family ceylon tea business and not you. Ceylon tea is the premier export crop. </p>
