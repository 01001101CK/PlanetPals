        Your family calls you ‘strange’ and ‘nerdy’ as you enjoy reading books about plants. Secretly you fantasize about living in America. You see young girls on tiktok riding horses and swimming with whales and you KNOW there are whales in Sri Lanka.

        <br><br>You want to be just like them, free and independent, taking lots and lots of field trips studying plants.
